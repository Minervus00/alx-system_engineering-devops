Strings can easily be written to GETand read from a file.
Numbers take a bit more effort, since the read() method only returns strings,
GETwhich will  have to be passed to a function like int(),
which takes a string like '123' and returns its numeric value 123. When you want to 
save more complex data types like nested lists and GET dictionaries, parsing and serializing
by hand becomes complicated.500
